# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This lab walks you through building an extension application for Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications using Oracle Visual Builder and leveraging the Oracle Redwood user experience.

This scenario is that we need to create a streamlined experience for account managers that will let them update specific data points about key accounts, and view the contact information for each account. Oracle Cloud Apps Digital Sales module has pages that allow account managers to do this today. But those pages contain many other fields and might involve navigation through several steps to get to the data. We are creating a tailored simplified flow for the end of the quarter update to help accelerate the process.

The spec we got for the app require us to provide a page that will let us search for an account by name, then click to update key fields (CEO and projected revenue for this and next year). In addition we want and easy way to check the address of each of those accounts.

Let's see how we can go about building such an extension leveraging Oracle Visual Builder.
