# Introduction

## About This Workshop

This lab shows you how to build an extension for Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications using Oracle Visual Builder Studio, while leveraging the Oracle Redwood user experience. An *extension* is what you use to deliver new capabilities into Oracle Fusion Cloud Applications.

Suppose you want to create a streamlined experience for your account managers, which will let them update specific data for key accounts, as well as view the contact information for each account. While Oracle Cloud Apps Digital Sales has pages that allow account managers to do this today, those pages also contain many other fields that might make it difficult to find the data requiring updates. We want a tailored, simplified flow for the end of the quarter update to help accelerate the process.

We've been asked to provide a page that will let the user search for an account by name, then click to update key fields like CEO name and projected revenue for this year and next. In addition, we want an easy way to check the address of each account.

Let's see how we can go about building such an extension&mdash;in this case, an extension containing our new page&mdash;using Oracle Visual Builder Studio (or "VB Studio" for short).

Estimated Workshop Time: 1 hour
